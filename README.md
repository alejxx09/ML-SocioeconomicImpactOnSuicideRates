# Socioeconomic Impact on Suicide Rates Analysis Project

## Overview

This project analyzes global suicide rates in relation to various socio-economic factors and internet usage. By utilizing datasets covering multiple years and countries, we aim to uncover trends and correlations that could provide insights into the causes and potential prevention strategies for suicide.

## Datasets

1. **Suicide Rates Dataset**: Contains historical data on suicide rates across different countries, broken down by year, sex, and age group.
2. **Socio-Economic Dataset**: Includes information on GDP, GNI, inflation rates, employment rates, and other economic indicators.
3. **Internet Usage Dataset**: Details the number of internet users by country and year.

## Objectives

1. **Impact of Internet Usage on Suicide Rates**: Investigate the hypothesis that increased internet usage correlates with a decrease in suicide rates.
2. **Socio-Economic Analysis**: Explore how various socio-economic factors such as GDP and employment rates influence suicide rates.
3. **Predictions**: Use machine learning models to predict future suicide rates up to the year 2030 based on historical data and identified trends.

## Methodology

### Data Analysis

- Descriptive statistics to understand the data distribution and identify key trends.
- Correlation analysis to find relationships between internet usage, socio-economic factors, and suicide rates.
- Visualization of data trends over time and across different regions.

### Machine Learning

- **Linear Regression**: Used to model the relationship between socio-economic factors and suicide rates.

### Key Findings

- **Internet Usage**: A significant negative correlation was found between internet usage and suicide rates, indicating that increased access to the internet may help reduce suicide rates.
- **Socio-Economic Factors**: Countries with lower GDP and poorer living conditions tend to have higher suicide rates. This trend is particularly noticeable in European countries.
- **Predictions**: The models predict an increasing trend in suicide rates in certain regions up to 2030, with notable differences between sexes and regions.

## Conclusion

The project highlights the complex interplay between internet usage, socio-economic conditions, and suicide rates. By understanding these relationships, policymakers and mental health professionals can better target their efforts to prevent suicides.
